            I see you are interested in my novel, but before we wonder into the
            land of fantasy I would like you to know that every statement, event,
            place, culture, quotes, saying e.t.c are just fiction.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            So, I wouldn't want anyone imitating anything that was written
            here or acting based on a saying in this novel. Please read this novel with the intention of getting entertained alone, don't expect any knowledge about anything from it, thank you and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="">
             Also, please note that there won't be a character page where a character's detail is written. You will come to know characters as they appear somewhere along the storyline and you get to decide how the characters seem to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I might describe most races, creatures, things, or festivals differently than they are, and than they are described in myths.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to broaden the scope of your imagination in a positive way, but let's keep it all in our imagination shall we?, thank you. With no further ado we are going to enter the broad world of Asfureruta.

            (Indistinct chatter), "This late? why didn't he let up until this late, I'll go get the doctor right away hang on", yes you must have figured, but I'm the one he's talking about, I finally decided to let my mother give birth to me after 48 hours past the normal time. What can I say the most important is always the last to come.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Well I'm finally out into the world, (baby crying) don't mind the cries in the background you would be crying too if you had to be spanked immediately you were given birth to, The annoying part is that I can't move to fight back. So, forgetting my tears, It seems I will now be the responsibily of these two before me, my parents. (gibberish talking) will they really be able to fulfil their responsibilities when none of us can understand each other?, I mean what is the meaning of 'baba boooo doooo satoooo sododododo', I'm really starting to doubt this whole thing (sighs).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After two months I now fully understand them, trust me my parents were more suprised than you are now. Apparantly, I am <span class="names">Nakuri Takezuki</span>, a bland name am I right?, and my mother is <span class="names">Aoi Takezuki</span>, while my father is <span class="names">Ken Takezuki</span>, To be given birth to by such a beautiful woman with golden hair, it might be me but sometimes it sparkles at night, bringing out the color of her eyes (In an amazed tone). All her features just seem to support each other. While my father is a total goof even to me a baby, he keeps making these stupid faces at me what does he expect me to do?, make stupid faces too?. Well I have to admit he makes some serious faces when they both discuss at dinner, makes him look a bit handsome.(ken - '(covers and reveals his face), boo, boo') I take that back he's doing the stupid faces again
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It troubles me that I can only respond to them with my body movement, even if I can understand them I can't talk back for some reason, every time I try to it ends up sounding completely different, (baby cooing), see!. Oh well, I guess it'll come naturally, I'm already a strange baby for being able to understand them I wouldn't want them to think I'm possessed now do I?. Now what troubles me is that whenever my Dad goes out for his so called work he always comes back with bruises, and then it's gone by the next morning, strange isn't it?. I try to not to sleep at night to see what happens, but when a beautiful woman feeds you warm milk you can't help but to sleep, can you? (In a cozy tone).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Five month after birth, it's feels nice to be able to be able to speak back, Normal babies shouldn't be able to understand Kaether until after three months, speak it until after six years, and walk until after seven months or so I'm told. I can't believe I'm strange for just a month difference, oh and Kaether is one of the common languages, I heard they're other languages can't wait to learn them. Well the first thing that came out of this mount hole of mine was "beautiful, you are so beautiful", and of course that was me to my mother (smirks). Next thing I'm hearing is "what about Dad (ken asks cheerfully)", i tried not to be rude so i told him "Maybe when you stop beign creepy", I wonder why he's sulking now.

            Yes you guessed it, it's the sixth month and guess who's on his feet I'm not really balanced yet though. Nothing more fun than having you Dad chase you when it's time to bathe, we do this every day I feel like I'm training him. Mom can't do it so he has no choice (chuckles). What I can believe is that I'm so much faster than him, is it because I'm naked? (confused). Something else happened later today, my Dad was teaching me how to throw a punch, and I was so wowed by the force of it, it was like he was splitting the air with his fist (amazed). He asked me to throw some and held his hand out, and so I copied exactly what he did, he pulled out right before impact but he's hand was broken well just one of them, he still has the other. My Mom quckly rushed over held his hand and placed her hand on his, a bright green light engulfed his hand and he's streching it like nothing happened. I had to ask "what was that (curiously asking)", my Mom said it was healing magic, I asked her healing magic. Dad quickly cut our conversation and said "Yes healing magic, you'll learn about it and other kinds of magic later on" and then he and my mother went to their room to have a conversation. Naturally I'm going to eavesdrop (sneaks to the door).

          <p>
            Ken - "Did you see what happened back there, how did he master my stance by just seeing me do it once, the disturbing part is that he's way stronger than I am if I didn't pull back, the force might have destoyed my whole arm, if not my whole upper half", Aoi - "Let's access this calmly we haven't accessed him properly, check his affinity, skills and potential let's do that first before anything else", Ken - "Fine I'll get a trusted person to do it, we wouldn't want anyone else finding out, if he's what I'm thinking he is. I thought he could finally go out and experince how it feels to be outside but it might take a while more" (Nakuri silently leavs the door befored they come out).
          </p>

            There you have it, I lost my chance of runnig naked outside (sighs), but I'm suprised by myself too can all children almost kill their father?. And so my Dad went to fetch someone that'll access me, he comes back in the evening with a man with glasses, I think he's around same age as my Dad, but not as built as he his. He came with a bunch of equipments, after taking a glance at me he was pale like he saw a ghost, he said "Let's take this somewhere else, that's if you don't want any other person finding out". My mom strectched out her hands, and this time she said something "<span class="space">Dimentional gate</span>"
