            I see you are interested in my novel, but before we wonder into the
            land of fantasy I would like you to know that every statement, event,
            place, culture, quotes, saying e.t.c are just fiction/totally made up.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            So, I wouldn't want anyone imitating anything that was writing
            here or acting based on a saying in this novel. Please read this novel with the intention of getting entertained alone, don't expect any knowlege about anything from it, thank you and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="">
             Also, please note that there won't be a character page wehre a character's detail is written. You will come to know character's as they appear somewhere along the storyline and you get to decide how the character's seem to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Futhermore, I might describe most races, creatures, things, or festivals differently than they are, and than they are described in myths.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to broaden the scope of your imagination in a positive way, but let's keep it all in our imagination shall we, thank you. With no further ado we are going to enter the broad world of Asfureruta.
