            I see you are interested in my novel, but before we wonder into the
            land of fantasy I would like you to know that every statement, event,
            place, culture, quotes, saying e.t.c are just fiction.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            So, I wouldn't want anyone imitating anything that was written
            here or acting based on a saying in this novel. Please read this novel with the intention of getting entertained alone, don't expect any knowledge about anything from it, thank you and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="">
             Also, please note that there won't be a character page where a character's detail is written. You will come to know characters as they appear somewhere along the storyline and you get to decide how the characters seem to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, I might describe most races, creatures, things, or festivals differently than they are, and than they are described in myths.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to broaden the scope of your imagination in a positive way, but let's keep it all in our imagination shall we?, thank you. With no further ado we are going to enter the broad world of Asfureruta.

            (Indistinct chatter), "This late? why didn't he let up until this late, I'll go get the doctor right away hang on", yes you must have figured, but I'm the one he's talking about, I finally decided to let my mother give birth to me after 48 hours past the normal time. What can I say the most important is always the last to come.
          </p>
          <br>

            Well I'm finally out into the world, (baby crying) don't mind the cries in the background you would be crying too if you had to be spanked immediately you were given birth to, The annoying part is that I can't move to fight back. So, forgetting my tears, It seems I will now be the responsibily of these two before me, my parents. (gibberish talking) will they really be able to fulfil their responsibilities when none of us can understand each other, I mean what is the meaning of 'baba boooo doooo satoooo sododododo', I'm really starting to doubt this whole thing.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After two months I now fully understand them, trust me my parents were more suprised than you are now. Apparantly, I am <span class="names">Nakuri Takezuki</span>, a bland name am I right?, and my mother is <span class="names">Aoi Takezuki</span>, while my father is <span class="names">Ken Takezuki</span>, To be given birth to by such a beautiful woman with yellow hair, it might be me but sometimes it sparkles at night. While my father is a total goof even to me a baby, he keeps making these stupid faces at me what does he espect me to do?, make stupid faces too?.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It troubles me that I can only respond to them with my body movement, even if I can understand them I can't talk back for some reason, every time I try to it ends up sounding completely different, (baby cooing), see!. Oh well, I guess it'll come naturally, I'm already a strange baby for being able to understand them I wouldn't want them to think I'm possessed. Now what troubles me is that whenever my Dad goes out for his so called work he always comes back with bruises, and then it's gone by the next morning, strange isn't it?.
          </p>

            Five month after birth, it's feels nice to be able to be able to speak back, Normal babies shouldn't be able to understand Kaether until after three months, and speak it until after six years or so I'm told. I can't believe I'm strange for just a month month difference, oh and Kaether is the common language I heard they're other languages can't wait to learn them.
