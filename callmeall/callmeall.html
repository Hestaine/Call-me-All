            I see you are interested in my novel, but before we wonder into the
            land of fantasy, I would like you to know that every statement, event,
            place, culture, quotes, saying e.t.c are just fiction.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            So, I wouldn't want anyone imitating anything that was written
            here or acting based on a saying in this novel. Please read this novel with the intention of getting entertained alone, don't expect any knowledge about anything from it, thank you and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="">
             Also, please note that there won't be a character page where a character's detail is written. You will come to know characters as they appear somewhere along the storyline and you get to decide how the characters seem to you.
            Furthermore, I might describe most races, creatures, things, or festivals differently than they are, and than they are described in myths.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to broaden the scope of your imagination in a positive way, but let's keep it all in our imagination shall we?, thank you. It goes without saying that you wil encounter a lot of things that's is not supposed to be like that, but as i said it's just an imaginative story for entertainment. With no further ado we are going to enter the broad world of Asfureruta.

            (Indistinct chatter), "This late? why didn't he let up until this late, I'll go get the doctor right away hang on", yes you must have figured, but I'm the one he's talking about, I finally decided to let my mother give birth to me after 48 hours past the normal time. What can I say the most important is always the last to come.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Well I'm finally out into the world, (baby crying) don't mind the cries in the background I can't control it for some reason, I guess my body is getting used to this new strange environment. So, forgetting my tears, It seems I will now be the responsibily of these two before me, my parents. (gibberish talking) will they really be able to fulfil their responsibilities when none of us can understand each other?, I mean what is the meaning of 'baba boooo doooo gatoooo bododododo', I'm really starting to doubt this whole thing (sighs).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After two months I now fully understand them, trust me my parents were more suprised than you are now. Apparantly, I am <a href="information.html" class="names">Nakuri Takezuki</a>, a bland name am I right?, and my mother is <a href="information.html" class="names">Aoi Takezuki</a>, while my father is <span class="names">Ken Takezuki</span>, To be given birth to by such a beautiful woman with golden hair, it might be me but sometimes it sparkles at night, bringing out the color of her eyes (In an amazed tone). All her features just seem to support each other. While my father is a total goof even to me a baby, he keeps making these stupid faces at me what does he expect me to do?, make stupid faces too?. Well I have to admit he makes some serious faces when they both discuss at dinner, makes him look a bit handsome.(ken - '(doing funny faces), boo, boo') I take that back he's making stupid faces again
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It troubles me that I can only respond to them with my body movement, even if I can understand them I can't talk back for some reason, every time I try to it ends up sounding completely different, (baby cooing), see!. Oh well, I guess it'll come naturally, I'm already a strange baby for being able to understand them I wouldn't want them to think I'm possessed now do I?. Now what troubles me is that whenever my Dad goes out for his so called work he always comes back with bruises, and then it's gone by the next morning, strange isn't it?. I try not to sleep at night to see what happens, but when a beautiful woman feeds you warm milk you can't help but to sleep, can you? (In a cozy tone).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Five month after birth, it's feels nice to be able to be able to speak back, Normal babies shouldn't be able to understand Kaether until after three months, speak it until after six years, and walk until after seven months or so I'm told. I can't believe I'm strange for just a month difference, oh and Kaether is one of the common languages, I heard they're other languages can't wait to learn them. That aside, the first thing that came out of this mouth hole of mine was "beautiful!, you are so beautiful", and of course that was me to my mother (smirks). Next thing I'm hearing is "what about Dad (ken asks cheerfully)", i tried not to be rude so i told him "Maybe when you stop beign creepy", I wonder why he's sulking now.

            It's the sixth month and yes it's what you guessed, I'm already on my feet but I'm not really balanced yet. Nothing more fun than having your Dad chase you when it's time to bathe, we do this every day I feel like I'm training him. Mom can't do it so he has no choice (chuckles). What I can believe is that I'm so much faster than him, is it because I'm naked? (confused).Well it appears he was running slowly, he mocks me and I'll be sure he gets whats coming. Anyways Ken keeps saying - "I can't wait to start training him", apparently he'll start training me when I'm balanced on my feet. I saw him doing push ups till he collapsed I really hope that's not how it's going go for me, I'm a little scared.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Training time someone helppp!!!, okay the first lesson is how to throw a punch, he explains about how musles work, how we move, gaining  mommentum, and some other boring things. He threw a punch to show me how it's done and I was so wowed by the force of it, it was like he was splitting the air with his fist (amazed). He asked me to throw one and held his hand out, and so I copied exactly what he did, he pulled back right before impact but his thumb was broken, that one didn't make it (wicked laugh) I guess we're even now he shouldn't have mocked me. My Mom quckly rushed over held his hand and placed her hand on his, a bright green light engulfed his hand and he's moving it like nothing happened. I finally know how his injuries heal now, then he and my mother went to their room to have a conversation. Naturally I'm going too but to eavesdrop (sneaks to the door).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Ken - "Did you see what happened back there?, that stance isn't something you can imitate just by seeing it once, the disturbing part is that his strenght is not normal for a toddler if I hadn't pulled back, the force might have broken more than just one finger, if not my whole arm", Aoi - "Let's access this calmly we haven't checked his affinity, strenght and his stronghold let's do that first before anything else", Ken - "Fine I'll get a trusted person to do it, we wouldn't want anyone else finding out, if he's what I'm thinking he is. If he's what I think he is we might have to move" (Nakuri silently leaves the door befored they come out).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There you have it, I'm somthing unknown and we might have to move, that all i can remember. And so my Dad went to fetch someone that'll access me, he comes back in the evening with a man wearing funny glasses, I think he's around same age as my Dad, but not as built as he his. He came with just a suitcase, after taking a glance at me he seemed to have developed interest, he said "Let's take this somewhere else, incase he's you know what" with a serious face on. My mom strectched out her hands again, and this time she said something "<span class="space">Dimentional gate</span>", a blue-purple like gate appeared before us, when we walked through it, it was just a wide landscape filled with grass. The sky was bright and the scenery was beautiful, the man my father brought home introduced himself as <span class="names">Max Kai</span> looks like he and my dad go ways back, he said he was an Acheologist, and Doctor. He also stated that he has little physical strenght, but a high affinity for magic. Don't worry you aren't alone I'm confused too.

          Before we started he called out to the box in his hand, he said "<span class="names">Glamour</span>, how long will u make me carry you". As he lets go of the suitcase, right before hitting the floor the suitcase turned into a little creature. He explains that the creatures's name is <span class="names">Glamour</span> and that he's a demon, he started by telling me about monsters that there are aggresive type monsters like dragons, greater orcs and some other ones..., and that there are tameable types like slimes, tigers and some other ones... .He explains most of this world's basic knowledge while he was at it, about how magic is widely used and about the creatures in the world apparently there are fairies, dryads, demons, beastmen, and dwarves. Also Glamour is a lesser demon and my parents seem to know him.
          </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Max has a high affinity for magic and little strenght, his potential is 50%. Oh I forgot to explain what I mean by potiential, he said potential represents how complex your use of magic can be, and that peaple often use spells to increase their potential, so I summed it up to being that potential doesn't actually limit your magic it just represents how open minded you are because if spells increase your potential it means your potential increased because you put what you were about to do in words therefore expressing it in your mind before actually doing it, then if you can always express it freely then there's no need for spells in other words be open minded. I explained this to them but they had the same expression as you I guess I'm bad at explaning so I gave an example "when Aoi healed Ken she didn't cast any spell because that was simple healing and she just needed to imagine his pinky getting healed, but when she summoned the dimentional gate she casted a spell and that's beacause creating a fake dimension and opening a gate to it is a little complex so she had to process it in her head and brand it a name that's easy for her to focus on". I'm talking too much don't get me wrong it's not that I'm actually interested in magic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Well it seems I have a riduculously high affinity for magic, and a ridiculous amount of strenght too. But, what was shocking to them is that I had a skill, my skill is called <span class="all">all</span> pretty strange. It looks like those in this world that have skills are considered misfits and killed unjustly, well they just come up with a stupid crime and kill the person truth is they are just scared. My dad said we'll be moving to the woods, I'm pretty sure that's not moving but I better keep shut cos it's my fault.(sighs) Things are not going my way recently.
