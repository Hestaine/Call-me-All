            I see you are interested in my novel, but before we wander into the
            land of fantasy, I would like you to know that every statement, event,
            place, culture, quotes, saying e.t.c are just fiction.
          </p>
          <p class="">
            So, I wouldn't want anyone imitating anything that was written
            here or acting based on a saying in this novel. Please read this novel with the intention of getting entertained alone, don't expect any knowledge about anything from it, thank you and enjoy.
          </p>
          <p class="">
             Also, please note that there won't be a character page where a character's detail is written. You will come to know characters as they appear somewhere along the storyline and you get to decide how the characters seem to you.
            Furthermore, I might describe most races, creatures, things, or festivals differently than they are, and than they are described in myths.
          </p>
          <p>
            I hope to broaden the scope of your imagination in a positive way, but let's keep it all in our imagination shall we?, thank you. It goes without saying that you wil encounter a lot of things that's not supposed to be like that, but as i said it's just an imaginative story for entertainment. With no further ado we are going to enter the wonderful world of Asfureruta.

            (Indistinct chatter), "This late? why didn't he let up until this late, I'll go get the doctor right away hang on". Yes you must have figured, but I'm the one he's talking about, I finally decided to let my mother give birth to me after 48 hours past the normal time. What can I say the most important is always the last to come.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Well I'm finally out into the world, (baby crying) don't mind the cries in the background I can't control it for some reason, I guess my body is getting used to this new strange environment. So, forgetting my tears, It seems I will now be the responsibily of these two before me, my parents. (gibberish talking) will they really be able to fulfil their responsibilities when none of us can understand each other?, I mean what is the meaning of 'baba boooo doooo gatoooo bododododo', I'm really starting to doubt this whole thing (sighs).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            After four months, I now fully understand them, trust me my parents were more suprised than you are now. Apparantly, I am <span class="names">Nakuri Takezuki</span>, a bland name am I right?, and my mother is <span class="names">Aoi Takezuki</span>, while my father is <span class="names">Ken Takezuki</span>, To be given birth to by such a beautiful woman with golden hair, it might be me but sometimes it sparkles at night, bringing out the color of her eyes (In an amazed tone). All her features just seem to support each other. While my father is a total goof even to me a baby, he keeps making these stupid faces at me what does he expect me to do?, make stupid faces too?. I wonder what sees in him, other than him being handsome (sighs).   (ken making funny faces), I take that back he's making stupid faces again
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It troubles me that I can only respond to them with my body movement, even if I can understand them  I can't talk back for some reason, every time I try to, it ends up sounding completely different, (baby cooing), see!. Maybe it's because of that white thing they call teeth, I don't have any so it may be the cause of my speechlessness. Leaving that aside somehting troubling is that whenever my Dad goes out for his so called work he always comes back with bruises, and then it's gone by the next morning, strange isn't it?. I try not to sleep at night to see what happens, but when a beautiful woman feeds you warm milk you can't help but to sleep, can you? (In a cozy tone).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
             Seven months after birth, it's feels nice to be able to be able to speak, I'm speaking this so called kaether like I was born with it, u might already know that Kaether is one of the common languages, I heard there are other languages too, can't wait to learn them. That aside, the first thing that came out of this mouth hole of mine was "My dear mother you are so beautiful", that made her really happy so I guess my first sentence did something meaningful. Although, the following sentence may have done the opposite, but what should I have done when my creepy dad came asking "what about Dad (ken asks cheerfully)", I merely told him "Maybe when you stop being creepy", I didn't expect him to sulk over those words. Hearing him repeating "when i stop being creepy" over and over made me realise that i should have lied and said something like "Oh you are not bad either".

            It's now eight months and yes it's what you guessed, I'm already on my feet but I'm not really balanced yet. Nothing more fun than having your Dad chase you when it's time to bathe, we do this every day I feel like I'm training him. Mom can't do it so he has no choice. What I can believe is that I'm so much faster than him, is it because I'm naked? (confused).Well it appears he was running slowly, he mocks me and I'll be sure he gets whats coming. Anyways Ken keeps saying - "I can't wait to start training him", apparently he'll start training me when I'm balanced on my feet. I saw him doing push ups till he collapsed I really hope that's not how it's going go for me, I'm a little scared.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            It's one year now, training time, just thinking about it is making me sick. Okay the first lesson is how to throw a punch, he explains about how musles work, how we move, gaining  mommentum, and some other boring things. He threw a punch to show me how it's done and I was so wowed by the force of it, it was like he was splitting the air with his fist (amazed). He asked me to throw one and held his hand out, and so I copied exactly what he did, he pulled back right before impact but his thumb was broken, that one didn't make it (wicked laugh) I guess we're even now he shouldn't have mocked me. My Mom quckly rushed over held his hand and placed her hand on his, a bright green light engulfed his hand and he's moving it like nothing happened. I finally know how his injuries heal now, then he and my mother went to their room to have a conversation. Naturally I'm going too but to eavesdrop (sneaks to the door).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Ken - "Did you see what happened back there?, that stance isn't something you can imitate just by seeing it once, the disturbing part is that his strenght is not normal for a toddler if I hadn't pulled back, the force might have broken more than just one finger, if not my whole arm", Aoi - "Let's assess this calmly we haven't checked his affinity, strenght and his stronghold let's do that first before anything else", Ken - "Fine I'll get a trusted person to do it, we wouldn't want anyone else finding out, if he's what I'm thinking he is. If he's what I think he is we might have to move" (Nakuri silently leaves the door befored they come out).
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            There you have it, I'm somthing unknown and we might have to move, that all i can remember. And so my Dad went to fetch someone that'll access me, he comes back in the evening with a man wearing funny glasses, I think he's around same age as my Dad, but not as built as he his. He came with just a suitcase, after taking a glance at me he seemed to have developed interest, he said "Let's take this somewhere else, incase he's you know what" with a serious face on. My mom strectched out her hands again, and this time she said something "<span class="space">Dimentional gate</span>", a blue-purple like gate appeared before us, when we walked through it, it was just a wide landscape filled with grass. The sky was bright and the scenery was beautiful, the man my father brought home introduced himself as <span class="names">Max Kai</span> looks like he and my dad go ways back, he said he was an Acheologist, and Doctor. He also stated that he has little physical strenght, but a high affinity for magic. Don't worry you aren't alone I'm confused too.

          Before we started he called out to the box in his hand, he said "<span class="names">Glamour</span>, how long will u make me carry you". As he lets go of the suitcase, right before hitting the floor the suitcase turned into a little creature. He explains that the creatures's name is <span class="names">Glamour</span> and that he's a demon, he started by telling me about monsters that there are aggresive type monsters like dragons, greater orcs and some other ones..., and that there are tameable types like slimes, tigers and some other ones... .He explains most of this world's basic knowledge while he was at it, about how magic is widely used and about the races in the world apparently there are fairies, dryads, demons, beastmen, and dwarves. Also Glamour is a lesser demon and my parents seem to know him.
          </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Max has a high affinity for magic and little strenght, his potential is 60%. Oh I forgot to explain what I mean by potiential, he said potential represents how complex your use of magic can be, and that peaple often use spells to increase their potential, so I summed it up to being that potential doesn't actually limit your magic it just represents how open minded you are because if spells increase your potential it means your potential increased because you put what you were about to do in words therefore expressing it in your mind before actually doing it, then if you can always express it freely then there's no need for spells in other words be open minded. I explained this to them but they had the same expression as you I guess I'm bad at explaning so I gave an example "when Aoi healed Ken she didn't cast any spell because that was simple healing and she just needed to imagine his pinky getting healed, but when she summoned the dimentional gate she casted a spell and that's beacause creating a fake dimension and opening a gate to it is a little complex so she had to process it in her head and brand it a name that's easy for her to focus on". I'm talking too much don't get me wrong it's not that I'm actually interested in magic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Well it seems I have a riduculously high affinity for magic, and a ridiculous amount of strenght too, and my potential is 90%. But, what was shocking to them is that I had a skill, my skill is called "<span class="all">All</span>" pretty strange right. It looks like those in this world that have skills are considered misfits and killed unjustly, well they just come up with a stupid crime and kill and execute them for it, they seem  scared of those with skills. My dad said we'll be moving to the forest around town, I'm pretty sure that's not moving but I better keep shut cos it's my fault. (sighs) Things are not going my way recently. Maxed used appraisal magic, which apparently only people with potential above 50% can give an accurate assessment. So, the person that's getting assessed will also have to showcase his strenght and magic a little, then that'll be used along side the assessment from the appraisal magic to be accurate.

          I was asked to cast a simple spell, he went first and showcased a mini batte. he fired a spell at my mom he said "<span class="fire">fire ball</span>" and a ball of <span class="fire">fire</span> was projected towards my mom, then my mom said "<span class="water">Water wall</span>", and a wall made of <span class="water">water</span> suddenly appeared before her. When the two magic spells clashed the water quenched the fire, so i guess my mom infused more magic to her water wall. It's my turn and my opponent is my mom, looks like her affinity is higher than max and my dad's, I was asked to cast <span class="fire">fire ball</span> with just little magic. I didn't feel the need for a spell because all I needed to do is imagine fire as a ball shot at someone, I tried to make it as weak as possible so as not to hurt my mom and so I held my hand out and a ball of fire started to form around my palm and I shot it towards my mom. It was bigger and faster than I thought it'd be, I'll have to work on my control. Anyways my mom didn't use <span class="water">water wall</span> this time, she casted "<span class="water">Water ball</span>" it was just slightly bigger than mine.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          That concludes my assessment, and my mom summoned another <span class="space">Dimentional gate</span> for us to go back, as soon as we got back she went to rest, apparently magic drains stamina which I have a ridiculous amount of too. We'll be relocating by teleporting, but that'll be after two days there's still a lot to do first like stocking food, and some other things. The next day, a strange looking man came with a boy around the same age as me, my dad seems to know him too. Just how many people does this old man know?, The strange man was invited in as a guest. He introduced himself to me as <span class="names">Weiner Brainhart</span>, it's a pretty weird name to me, his son's name is <span class="names">Zack Brainhart</span>. Just who are this people and why are they invading our home?, Weiner seems like he has something really serious to discuss with my parent. They went in to discuss, I would've gone to eavesdrop immediately, but I didn't want to leave this kid all by himself, so I did the only thing left to do - Dragging him along.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Even though he didn't wnat to come at first this kid is really good at eavesdropping, he's even controlling his breathing so we won't be noticed. Weiner - "I think Zack might be an anomaly, this is just my intuition but I want to play it safe. I would like Max to be the one to appraise him incase, we are already preparing to move if he is", I knew it was going to end up like this, looking at the kid he doesn't look normal. Also, anomalies are what people with skills are called. Ken - "I don't think you would have an anomaly, well is an anomaly, so I'ld like to help you if I can", Weiner - "What -". Ken - "We just accessed him yesterday, Max is still in town he's helping us in preparation to move, he should be back soon", Aoi - "Anyways let's continue this conversation after we've accesed Zack". This is giving me a weird sense of deja vá½».

        <p class="">
          We're back in mom's grass dimention, I was only brought along because I couldn't be left at home alone. Anyways, Zack has a riduculously high affinity and a riduculous amonut of strenght, 95% potential, and a skill called "<span class="all">Aquire</span>". Testing his abilities is all that's left now, he was also asked to cast <span class="fire">fire ball</span> in a mock battle against my mom. He also didn't use a spell, his <span class="fire">fire ball</span> was just a little bit smaller than mine, as he fired the spell, it had almost hit my mom just immediately after being. None of us expected it to be that fast, but there was someone faster than the firebal - my dad. The spell may have been faster because of the potential difference, but I'm more interested in how my dad is able to move like that. Strange, none of the adults looked worried when zack's <span class="fire">fire ball</span> was fired, they must've known that dad'll protect mom. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Zack looked really scared after that, like he was expecting to be punished. But, to his suprise he was praised instead mom said - "You are amazing, you are still a kid but your magic controll is impressive, don't worry about what happened earlier, I'm at fault for letting my guard down". His mood changed a little when the adults consoled him, but I wonder why he scared in the first place. After the assessment, my Mom proposed for us to be left in the grass dimension because she thinks we'll be in the way for preparation, the adults plan on having a big meeting with my parents, Max, Weiner, and his wife. She left some snacks and said "You boys should get to know yourself a little", I don't think she realises that putting two kids in another dimesnsion on their own is a good idea, I feel like they've all forgotten that we're still kids (sighs). Well, it's not a bad thing at least I can get to know more about this kid.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          We were asked to get to know each other, but this kid looks scared of me. I knew he wouldn't move first so I had to, I just straight up told him what I felt i told him - "You are a strange kid, but either way u seem interesting, so I would like to get to know you" I'm happy he replied, but his reply was something unbelieveable, at least we are getting somewhere. He said - "I'm <span class="names">Zack Brainhart</span> as you already know, and I'm from another word", what does he mean his from another word (confused). Wait who am I even asking (sighs), so i asked him what do you mean you are from another world. He said - "I guess you wouldn't believe me, well it does sound unbelieveable to people of this world", I told him that it isn't that I don't beleive him I just need him to explain well so I can understand him. And than he says - "It's easier to show you than to explain".

          He place his hand on his head, and on mine. All his memories were flowing into my head, I could see every single thing that happened in his past life's memory. Apparently that other world is called earth, and his life in that world to me was horribe. He hardly ever stands out, and he's always bulied wherever he goes. He was all alone, and his death was very funny but there's no how i could laugh in that situation. He planned on commiting suicide but he couldn't pull to, just as he was thinking of a painless way to die, he remebered how the <span class="names">Satou Kazuma</span> died, and then he started choking on his water water, if only he had drank his water first, He's no better than Kazuma who taught a tracktor was a truck (laughs). Now that I know his past, I understand why he was scared earlier, if he did anything to make him stand out a little his bullies would always make him regret it. I also understood how he was able to share his memories with magic, after seeing all those animes he watched I bet he could do a lot more with magic.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          That being said, now that I know his troubles I can't just do nothing. So, I gathered knowledge from all the animes and any other information from his memories and then I told him "This is not your other world, right now you are not <span class="names">Zanabe Tachibana</span> in Okawa, you are <span class="names">Zack Brainhart</span> in Asfureruta, sorry I don't know your hometown here. This is not your former world so don't live like you used to, u don't need to feel scared or alone anymore. I'll be your first friend but I'm sure that you'll make others. Just focus on doing things that makes you happy". He looked really delighted like a boulder has been lifted off him, I feel really proud of myself motivating someone like that.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="">
          Well that's resolved, I feel like I'm someone else after experiencing his memories, but I finally know why my potential was at 90%, and why his was at 95%. Watching all those animes brought a lot of ideas on how to use magic, so firstly I use appraisal magic to see if anything changed for Zack, I wasn't suprised that hisk potential went up to 100%. I asked him to appraise me too, and my potential is also at 100%, why wouldn't it be after witnessing rasengans, kamehamehas, crimson magic, and many more. witnessing more than 20 years of someones memory is draining but this was worth it. A while later, our parent came to their senses and immediately came to get us.

            It looks like our parents decided on moving together. My mom will make a two ways trip, teleporting our house to the forest first, and then going to Zack's town to teleport their house to forest too. You might be thinking who would just teleport a house in the middle of town, but our hose was at the outskirts of town so not much people will notice, I don't know about Zack's house. They really meant it when they said preparation, the woods in the spot our house was teleported too has already been cleared, must be Dad's doing. One thing I'm happy about, is that I now have a training buddy, my parents offered to train Zack too. Dad will be training us on combat and swordsmanship, and Mom will be training us on magic.

          <br>
          <p class="">
            It's been four years now, it's about time we started getting practical training. Up till now, we've just been studying fact's on magic, combat, and swordsmanship. Despite how they are my parents are suprisingly considerate, I mean we were just one year old back then, it would be crazy to start giving us practical training then. Zack's mom <span class="names">Alice Brainhart</span> was a teacher before she got married, so she handled our academics. While my Mom and dad (former adventurers), handled our comvat lessons. Most of things in Asfureruta are a bit similar to earth things, the only difference is the landscape, culture's, language, races, and animals. I really like the japanese language of earth so, I learnt it from Zack's memory.
